# Hi there! I'm Javier Trujillo ðŸ‘‹
But everyone calls me **Javi**.

I'm a Software Engineering student at the **University of Colima** with a passion for coding, fitness, and spending time outdoors with my three dogs. When I'm not in front of my computer, you can usually find me at the gym, going for walks, or playing with my pups.

Currently, I'm learning **Java** and expanding my knowledge in various areas of **Information Technology** to reinforce my skills.

Feel free to explore my repositories and follow my coding journey! ðŸš€
